Dr Micah Altman is a social and information scientist at MIT's Center for Research on Equitable and Open Scholarship. (Previously, he served as Director of Research for the MIT Libraries, Head/Scientist for the Program on Information Science, Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution; and at Harvard University as the Associate Director of the Harvard-MIT Data Center, Archival Director of the Henry A. Murray Archive, and Senior Research Scientist in the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences.)

Dr. Altman conducts research, provides public commentary, and collaborates in initiatives related to how information technologies change politics, society, and science. He is the author of over one hundred scientific and scholarly articles -- as well as a spectrum of books, opinion pieces, databases and software packages. His recently published research establishes requirements for reliable information anonymization and privacy; evaluates the alignment of artificial intelligence and trustworthy science; examines bias in scholarly communication and peer review; critiques the evidence-base for open science; and examines the role of public participation and institutional design in constraining redistricting.

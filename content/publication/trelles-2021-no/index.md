abstract: '
An independent bureaucracy has carried out automated redistricting
processes in Mexico since 1996. However, the process of “fine-tuning” the
plans that are initially produced by formula is conducted behind closed
doors where parties and experts are allowed to offer proposals. This raises
questions about the necessary conditions required for a bureaucracy to
operate in a transparent, consistent, and accountable manner. Our research
examines this question through the analysis of private records that trace the
bargaining process that takes place between parties and bureaucrats. Our
results uncover substantial gaps in consistency. We highlight the strengths
of the process and offer policy recommendations that can help improve the
quality of redistricting in Mexico and in countries cyclically renewing their
electoral geography.

    abstract = { Since 1996, an independent bureaucracy in Mexico has carried out a redistricting process purportedly founded in machine optimization of plans based on open and objective criteria. However, the process of “fine-tuning” the plans that are initially produced by formula is conducted behind closed doors where parties and experts are allowed to offer counter-proposals. This raises questions about the necessary conditions required for a bureaucracy to operate in a transparent, consistent, and accountable manner. Our research examines this question through the analysis of private records that trace the bargaining process that takes place between parties and bureaucrats. Analysis uncovers substantial gaps in transparency and consistency. Accountability in the Mexican redistricting process remains wanting without these. }

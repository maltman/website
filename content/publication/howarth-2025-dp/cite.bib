abstract = {There is a need in the community of privacy practitioners for a trustworthy, collaborative shared database of differentially private deployments, to help foster norms about best practices. We propose a shared governance resource to (1) help industry grow to consensus on best practices, (2) provide public snapshots of the privacy landscape so that regulators can judge new deployments in context and shape guidance accordingly, and (3) incentivize industry to make their choices public. We describe an initial schema to systematize this information and an editorial and governance process to ensure this information is reliable.},

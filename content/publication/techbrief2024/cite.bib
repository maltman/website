    abstract = {The new edition concerns the proliferation of data collection, advanced algorithms, and powerful computers which have made it easy to piece together information about individuals’ private lives from public information—even as controls over information privacy become increasingly ineffective. In an era of ubiquitous data collection and massive computing capacity, society faces unprecedented challenges to protecting information privacy. Technical advances in the fields of computer science, statistics, and information science both starkly illuminate privacy risks and have the potential to provide a foundation for privacy protection that is more systematic and effective.

abstract: '
In this paper, we develop a set of technical requirements for anonymization rules and related regulations. The requirements are derived by situating within a simple abstract model of data processing a set of guiding general principles put forth in prior work. We describe an approach to evaluating such regulations using these requirements -- thus enabling the application of the general principles for the design of mechanisms. As an exemplar, we evaluate competing interpretations of regulatory requirements from the EUs General Data Protection Regulation.

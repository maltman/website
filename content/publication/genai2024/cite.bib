    abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is disrupting the traditional ways we maintain and signal trustworthiness and integrity of science. In this paper, we review the emerging and potential roles of GenAI in science policy and as part of the scientific information infrastructure. We then identify a core set of research questions to enable the use of GenAI with scientific integrity to advance open, equitable, and trustworthy scholarship. }

abstract: '
We introduce "Natural" differential
privacy (NDP) -- which utilizes features of existing
hardware architecture to implement differentially
private computations. We show that NDP both
guarantees strong bounds on privacy loss and
constitutes a practical exception to no-free-lunch
theorems on privacy. We describe how NDP can be
efficiently implemented and how it aligns with
recognized privacy principles and frameworks.

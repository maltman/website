abstract: '
The absence of standardized measurement and reporting hinders progress toward more reliable and equitable scientific practices. This topic brief summarized existing practice across stages of the research lifecycle to promote transparency and reliability, and to support the evaluation of participation and equity. The brief also discusses issues surrounding integrating these practices within the context of limited-term fellowship programs.

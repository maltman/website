abstract: 'Redistricting affects directly the translation of votes to seats, and is
therefore one of the most politicized procedures within electoral
management. Mexico’s approach is unique – since 1996 an independent
board has been creating plans algorithmically. Parties, however, are able to
formulate hundreds of counter-proposals in a closed-door environment.
We ask: Why and when do political parties engage in the process, and
what is the political consequence of their participation? To address these
questions, we analyze a unique data set comprising all the submitted
partisan map proposals during the 2013 and 2017 redistricting rounds. Our
analysis reveals parties’ plans have surprisingly marginal partisan effects.
We find a combination of redistricting criteria, demographic shifts, and
voting preferences – rather than partisan gerrymandering – account for the
stability of electoral outcomes.'
